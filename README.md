 NFC Cards
------------

With the advent of NFC technology being also introduced into the gaming community we can now use physical objects to boot our digital games. Maybe you're like me, you have hundreds of games in your digital collection (Steam or otherwise) and miss the good old days where you grabbed a cartridge or disk from your collection and put it in your favorite console or PC. But for whatever reason you don't use it because it's cumbersome, expensive, doesn't start half the time or the box takes too much shelf space. 

If you recognize any of the above then this is the perfect solution for you. A NFC reader with a game(path) flashed to a NFC card (exp. NTAG215). After setting the software up (more on that later), simply insert the NFC card into the NFC reader and watch your favorite games being booted just like old times! These cards are as small as you want them to be and won't break the bank collecting, nor do they take up a lot of space so you can have hundreds of them and they'll only take up a fraction of the space an entire collection would have. 
Cue my personally designed database with games that I like to play. I have made individual card covers that you can simply print with your desired software and printer and then apply to your NFC cards.
I made NFC card covers for both steam games and oldschool retro games to be run with emulators. 


I do not take responsibility for how you obtain the games you end up playing with these card, games need to be sourced in a legal way in accordance to the laws and regulations of the country you reside in.

All of the covers are free to be used for personal use. If you like what you see and want to support me anyway you can buy me a cup of coffee [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/anime0t4ku)
