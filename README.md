 NFC Cards
------------
With the advent of NFC technology making its way into the gaming community, we can now use physical objects to launch our digital games. If you're like me and have hundreds of games in your digital collection (Steam or otherwise), you might miss the good old days of grabbing a cartridge or disk from your shelf and popping it into your favorite console or PC. But for various reasons, you don't use physical media anymore—maybe it's cumbersome, expensive, unreliable, or the cases take up too much space.

If any of that sounds familiar, then I have the perfect solution for you: an NFC reader paired with a game path flashed to an NFC card (e.g., NTAG215). After setting up the necessary software (more on that later), simply insert the NFC card into the reader and watch as your favorite game boots up, just like in the old days! These cards are compact, affordable to collect, and take up a fraction of the space that a traditional physical collection would. Enter my collection of designs for the games I enjoy playing. I’ve created custom card covers that you can print using your preferred software and printer, then apply to your NFC cards. I’ve made card covers for both Steam games and retro games that can be run via emulators.

I must note that I am not responsible for how you obtain the games you play with these cards—please ensure that you source them legally, in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country.

If you'd like to know more about which software or NFC reader you need, head over to [wizzo.dev](http://wizzo.dev) to learn more. You can also join our Discord server, where I, along with other talented people, are active. Feel free to join us and ask questions!

All the covers are free to use for personal purposes. If you like what you see and want to support me, you can buy me a cup of coffee at [BuyMeACoffee](https://github.com/Anime0t4ku/NFC-Cards).
